# [PyTorch](pytorch.org) Tutorial

This config contains files from the tutorial I followed from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp)'s YouTube channel taught by [Danial Bourke](https://github.com/mrdbourke). The tutorial is a 25-hour long video that covers the basics of PyTorch. The tutorial is divided into 4 parts:

1. Fundamentals
2. Workflow
3. Neural Network - Classification
4. Computer Vision
5. Custom Dataset
